    <h2>Post 2 - Places to Hike</h2>
    <p>
      Are you looking to hike this summer? I have hiked all over Toronto and
      here are the top 2 places I recommend!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Scarborough Bluffs Park</h3></li>
      <img

        height="auto"
        width="400px"
      />
      <p>
        At roughly 6,400m long with minimal elevation gain and loss, it's the
        perfect place for beginners to try hiking as well as get an amazing view
        at Toronto's Great Lake!
      </p>

      <li><h3>Rouge National Urban Park</h3></li>
      <img
        src="./blogpost2-2.jpg"
        alt="Rouge National Urban Park Hike"
        height="auto"
        width="400px"
      />
      <p>
        The Glen Eagles Vista Train at Rouge National Urban Park is an easy 600m
        Hike with amazing views of the rivers path. What's even better is that
        after the hike you can visit the Toronto Zoo or even Rouge beach which
        are located right next to Rouge National Urban Park!
